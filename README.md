DuOS is an operating system created on Feb 26, 2026. Created by Darii, This was a Hobby Project, and i do Not Recommend Using this as your operating system....
Feb 24, 2026
-------------
decided to make a Linux distro
installed the ubuntu iso and ran it in virtual box
I followed a youtube tutorial that day
it failed BADLY...




---------------------------
Feb 25, 2026
---------------------------
decided to build my own Linux distro.. again
downloaded archlinux and ran it in a vm
used archinstall to create UDOS (Useless Dari's Operating System)
called it UDOS 0.1
installed additional packages
I was  happy that day
had trouble trying to download snake on it
because it couldn't locate many packages

note: the packages were for Debian based systems
like kali Linux


I hit the sack

feb 25, 2026 i copied the vdi to a flash drive(i transferred the vdi completely cuz i couldn't build the iso for it)
and promised to show it to the computer teacher
she didn't look at it

and when i came back home i
decided to move to Debian based systems 
downloaded the Debian iso and ran it on virtualbox
it spent the entire day downloading stuff
plus 7 hours wasted because of school
when it finished I had already slept....





------------------------------------
Feb 27, 2026
------------------------------------
I removed the Debian iso from the vm
to be more specific, I removed the iso file under controller: IDE
that booted me into an installer I can configure to my likings
idk why Debian has these features
anyways so I installed xfce4 on it
and it WORKED
I created a file called setup.sh that downloads all the games and stuff for you
then I modified a system file (in the vm)
that checks if the file has ran one time

Note: virtualbox creates virtual hard disks for your machine, and whenever you run Debian inside a vm, it copies files from their website to your virtual hard disk. so you can have the Debian system all for yourself

feb 28 2026 is the day i got my main computer back, and i could stop using my dad's computer
(shoutout to him i owe him a big favor)
i copied the vdi DUOS [0.2] to the flash drive and transferred it to MY computer 
where on my computer i used live-boot to make its ISO
i was so happy
plus that was the day i started to write this
i slept 1:00 AM that day :D
I know im saying "that day" too much
u just gotta live with it
