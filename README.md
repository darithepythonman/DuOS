on this day.. i decided to make my own operating system .
i previously had created my own operating system by scratch
but i hadnt finished it completely.
plus it was buggy..
now seriously
on Feb 24, 2026
i decided to make my own linux distro
i followed a youtube tutorial called "how to make your own linux distro".
  Note: at this time my main computer had been taken away by my parents, Because i had exams that week
i downloaded virtualbox and the ubuntu iso
and when i tried to build the ISO, it was F##KED
feb 24 was a Miserable Fail
i decided to hit the sack
