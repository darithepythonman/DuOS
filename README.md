# DuOS
DuOS is an operating system created on Feb 26, 2026. Created by Darii, This was a Hobby Project, and i do Not Recommend Using this as your operating system....
Feb 24, 2026
-------------
decided to make a Linux distro
installed the ubuntu iso and ran it in virtual box
I followed a youtube tutorial that day
it failed BADLY...




---------------------------
Feb 25, 2026
---------------------------
decided to build my own Linux distro.. again.
 so i downloaded archlinux and ran it in a vm.
i used archinstall to create UDOS (Useless Dari's Operating System), and i 
called it UDOS 0.1.
i installed additional packages like drivers, pulse audio, neofetch.
I was so happy but i 
had trouble trying to download snake on it. Why? 
because it couldn't locate many packages

note: the packages were for Debian based systems
like kali Linux.


I hit the sack.

feb 25, 2026 i copied the vdi to a flash drive(i transferred the vdi completely cuz i couldn't build the iso for it)
and promised to show it to the computer teacher.
she didn't look at it :(
and when i came back home i
decided to move to Debian based systems. 
 i downloaded the Debian iso and ran it on virtualbox.
it spent the entire day downloading stuff
plus 7 hours wasted because of school.
when it finished I had already slept....

------------------------------------
Feb 27, 2026
------------------------------------
I removed the Debian iso from the vm.
to be more specific, I removed the iso file under controller: IDE.
that booted me into an installer I can configure to my likings
idk why Debian has these features.
anyways so I installed xfce4 on it
and it WORKED.
I created a file called setup.sh that downloads all the games and stuff for you
then I modified a system file (in the vm).
that checks if setup.sh has ran before.

Note: virtualbox creates virtual hard disks for your machine, and whenever you run Debian inside a vm, it copies files from their website to your virtual hard disk. so you can have the Debian system all for yourself.

feb 28 2026 is the day i got my main computer back, and i could stop using my dad's computer
(shoutout to him i owe him a big favor)
i copied the vdi ( DUOS [0.2]) to the flash drive and transferred it to MY computer 
where on my computer i used live-boot to make its ISO.
i was so happy
plus that was the day i started to write this in notepad.
i slept 1:00 AM.

i decided to upload it to github
to get some recogniton.
but then the new came on.
"BREAKING NEWS: WW3 MIGHT BE HAPPENING"
"AMERICA HAS BOMBED IRAN"
Keep in mind I LIVE IN IRAQ.
I COULD HEAR MISSLES FROM OUTSIDE
AND THEN
"IRAN IS BOMBING ISREAL".
THEN I HEAR EVEN LOUDER MISSLES OUTSIDE.
IRAN IS SENDING MISSLES TORWARDS TEL AVIV.
ALL WIFI AND INTERNET CONNECTIONS ARE CUT OFF IN IRAN.
i almost pissed my pants when i heard some of the missles fell mid way to bombing isreal
ik im exagerrating but like its a death situation i can die if they send an atomic bomb
